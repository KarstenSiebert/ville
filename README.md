A Social Loyalty & Prediction Market

This repository contains the core implementation of a Social Loyalty and Prediction Market system designed to combine community engagement with market-based forecasting mechanisms.

The project explores how decentralized incentives, reputation systems, and token-based participation models can be integrated to reward meaningful contributions while enabling transparent prediction markets. It is intended as an experimental framework for building trust-driven ecosystems where loyalty, participation, and forecasting interact in a measurable and programmable way.

The codebase provides a foundation for:

Social loyalty mechanics and reputation tracking

Market-based prediction models

Tokenized incentive structures

Transparent and auditable interaction logic

This project is open for experimentation, research, and further development. Contributions, discussions, and improvements are welcome.
